## Context

A database is required to store:
- Subscription data (email, city, frequency, confirmation status, tokens)
- Tokens for confirmation and unsubscription
- Timestamps for subscription creation and updates

All authentication is handled via email confirmation links; there are no user accounts or passwords.

## Considered Options

### 1. PostgreSQL
**Pros:**
- ACID transactions, high reliability and consistency
- Powerful query capabilities
- Native JSON support for flexible weather data storage
- Ready for production workloads

**Cons:**
- More complex Docker setup
- Requires a migration system

### 2. MongoDB
**Pros:**
- Flexible schema, easy work with JSON
- Simple scaling for document-based data

**Cons:**
- Eventual consistency, more complex migrations

### 3. SQLite
**Pros:**
- Simple setup, file-based database

**Cons:**
- Limited concurrent access

## Decision

**PostgreSQL** was chosen as the main database.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Reliability and data consistency
- Powerful query capabilities
- JSON support for weather data
- Ready for production workloads

**Negative:**
- More complex Docker setup
- Need for a migration system
